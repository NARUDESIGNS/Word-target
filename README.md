# Word Target
This game is almost similar to the way you spell words on Scrabble. <br>
It provides you with letters also called Tiles. Each tile has a point. <br>
The game gives you a target and the length of characters of the word it expects you to spell. <br>
It uses [Free Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/) to validate the word you spell and determine whether or not it is accepted. <br>
